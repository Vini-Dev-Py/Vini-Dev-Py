Hello, let's get to know a little of the simplest command of the Python programming language o print ()
pritn('Ol√°, Dev !')
The print() function is always accompanied by parentheses, 
if you already move or have seen something about programming languages, you must remember that every command ends with ";" 
Python does not use this condition!

Python accepts both single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") in its strings.
now you must be wondering what a string is.

A "string" and all messages within quotation marks ('' or "")

we can see in the example below
print ('Hello world")
print ("Hello world")


In the next class, we'll look at variables and the "input ()" function, even more Dev
